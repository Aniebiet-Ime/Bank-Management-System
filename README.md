This is a read me file which explains and showcases the program which acts as a bank management application. 
This program simulates basic bank services like transfers, withdrawals, deposits and others. 
It is built on a dictionary designed account database which has a 6-digit code set as the account number for all the accounts in the dictionary and a 4-digit code which is set as the pin.
The program is designed to handle all financial transactions, and has been optimised to handle all eventualities of error occurences in the program.
It is built with object oriented programming to ensure modularity and scalability in the program. There is only one instance of a major class in the program and multiple occurences 
of sub classes, all which are done to ensure the smooth running of the program and easy readability.
